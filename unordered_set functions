`std::unordered_set` is a C++ container that represents a collection of unique elements with no specific order. It provides several useful member functions for working with unordered sets. Here are some of the key functions:

1. **`insert`:**
   - Inserts an element into the unordered_set.

   ```cpp
   std::unordered_set<int> mySet;
   mySet.insert(42);
   ```

2. **`emplace`:**
   - Constructs and inserts an element into the unordered_set.

   ```cpp
   mySet.emplace(13);
   ```

3. **`find`:**
   - Searches for an element and returns an iterator to it.

   ```cpp
   auto it = mySet.find(42);
   if (it != mySet.end()) {
       // Element found
   }
   ```

4. **`erase`:**
   - Removes an element from the unordered_set.

   ```cpp
   mySet.erase(13);
   ```

5. **`size`:**
   - Returns the number of elements in the unordered_set.

   ```cpp
   std::cout << "Size: " << mySet.size() << std::endl;
   ```

6. **`empty`:**
   - Checks if the unordered_set is empty.

   ```cpp
   if (mySet.empty()) {
       // Set is empty
   }
   ```

7. **`clear`:**
   - Removes all elements from the unordered_set.

   ```cpp
   mySet.clear();
   ```

8. **`count`:**
   - Returns the number of elements with a specific value (1 or 0).

   ```cpp
   if (mySet.count(42) > 0) {
       // Value 42 exists
   }
   ```

9. **`bucket_count`:**
   - Returns the number of buckets in the underlying hash table.

   ```cpp
   size_t buckets = mySet.bucket_count();
   ```

10. **`bucket`:**
    - Returns the bucket number where an element is located.

    ```cpp
    size_t bucketNumber = mySet.bucket(42);
    ```

11. **`begin` and `end`:**
    - Provide iterators pointing to the beginning and end of the unordered_set.

    ```cpp
    for (auto it = mySet.begin(); it != mySet.end(); ++it) {
        // Iterate through the set
    }
    ```

These functions cover the basic operations you might perform on an `std::unordered_set`. Depending on your specific use case, you may also find additional functions in the C++ standard library documentation that can be helpful.
